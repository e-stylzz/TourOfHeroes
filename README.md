#Testing some Angular & Typescript.
##Also playing around with Angular Material.

####Stuff to do:
1. Restructure files into module/component folders
2. Do more with the UI (Angular Material)
3. Have a SRC/DIST folder.  Target JS build files to DIST folder and make sure everything works.

*Figure out why I had to add so much stuff to system.config.js to get angular material to work.  Clearly missing something here...I hope.*
