Testing some Angular & Typescript.
Also playing around with Angular Material.

Stuff to do:
Restructure files into module/component folders
Do more with the UI (Angular Material)
Have a SRC/DIST folder.  Target JS build files to DIST folder and make sure everything works.

Figure out why I had to add so much stuff to system.config.js to get angular material to work.  Clearly missing something here...I hope.
